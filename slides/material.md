### <h2 style = "color:brown">Planning</h2>
Planning refers to the process of setting objectives for a given time period, formulating various courses of action to achieve them and then selecting the best possible alternative from among the various courses of action available.

In this presentation we will discuss about the importance of planning in business, management and organizations.



Planning is the first and the most important function of management. It is needed at every level of management. Without planning all the activities of a business organisation will be meaningless rendering the attainment of objectives merely a dream. Because of the increasing size and complexities of the organisations planning has come to assume more importance.

Planning is a pre-requisite not only for achieving success but also as for surviving in a complex and competitive world. It forces organizations to look ahead and decide their future course of action so as to improve their profitability.



The main benefits of planning:
1. <b>Planning provides directions</b>: By stating the objectives in advance, planning provides direction for action. Planning ensures that the goals or objectives are clearly stated so that they act as a guide for deciding the future course of action. When goals are well defined, employees know in advance what the organisation has to do and what they must do to achieve these goals.



2. <b>Planning reduces the risk of uncertainity</b>: Planning enables the manager to look ahead and anticipate changes and prepare for the risk by making necessary provisions. The uncertainties cannot be eliminated, but the can be anticipated and managerial responses for them can be developed.



<b>For E.g.:</b> In order to fix a sales target, a survey can be undertaken to find out the number of new companies likely to enter the new market. By keeping these facts in minds and planning the future activities, the possible difficulties can be avoided. 



3. <b>Planning reduces overlapping and wasteful activities</b>: Planning coordinates the efforts of different divisions, departments and individuals. It helps in avoiding the confusion, misunderstanding and minimising useless activities. Planning also makes it easier to detect inefficiencies and take corrective measures to deal with them.



4. <b>Planning promotes innovative ideas</b>: While planning, many new ideas arise and it results into creative, innovative and foresighted attitude among the managers. Such new ideas can take the shape of concrete plans. 



5. <b>Planning facilitates decision making</b>:

Planning helps in taking rational decisions by setting targets and predicting future conditions. Planning helps the manager to look into the future and make a choice from amongst various alternative courses of action. The manager has to evaluate each alternative and select the best one.



6. <b>Planning establishes standards for controlling</b>: Controlling involves comparison of actual performance with the pre-determined standards. By comparing actual performance with the standards, managers can know whether they have actually been able to attain the goals or not. In case of any adverse deviation, the management can take remedial measures to improve the results. In the absence of plans, a manager will have no standards for controlling the actual performance. 



<b>For eg:</b> A labourer is to do 10 units of work in a day (it is a matter of planning). But actually he completes 8 units. Thus there is negative deviation of 2 units. For this, he is held responsible. Thus, in the absence of planning controlling is not possible.



<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
Thus it can be rightly concluded that planning is a process of 'thinking before doing'. It bridges the gap between where we are and where we want to go.
